                            I am a motivated Software Programmer with a strong interest in virtual reality and interactive technologies. 
                            My experience includes programming in C++, C# and Javascript, working with engines like Unreal Engine 5 and Unity, 
                            and creating different codes for AI. I enjoy solving technical challenges, building efficient systems, and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. 
                            I'm always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to innovative projects.

                                as a pause menu that allows the player to pause, resume, and return to the main menu. I also programmed the moment when the player 
                                falls off the platforms and the game ends.
                                This game was developed using Unity, programmed in C#, and submitted to the game jam:

                                <p>In this game, I took on the role of programmer. I programmed the logs and spikes that fall from the sky, 
                                their random generation and disappearance. I also programmed the breaking of the platform when it connects with the spikes, 
                                implemented the art for these elements, and finally programmed how the frogs use their tongues to push each other.

                                <p>This program allows the user to perform various calculations with matrices. The operations I programmed include addition, 
                                subtraction, matrix inversion using the Gauss-Jordan method, and matrix reduction using Gaussian elimination to solve all types of 
                                linear equation systems.
                                This program was created using Visual Studio and programmed in C#.

                                <p>This project involved a series of models and value matrices which were later translated into code to test the initial theory. 
                                It shows the interaction between different player taxonomies described by Bartle and displays graphs showing how the number of users in the game can 
                                vary depending on the number of each player type present.
                                In this project, I was responsible for assigning and refining the matrix values to implement them in the final result. The rest of the work was done collaboratively with the other project creator, with both of us contributing equally to all parts.
                                This network model was developed using Matlab.

                                <p>In this game, I took on the role of head of programming. I programmed the enmies AI, efficient code structures for other parts of the game such as
                                the player, and all the menu interface. I was also in charge of all the version control of the game.
                                With this game we were able to attend numerous events like: <a href="https://www.devuego.es/deventos/evento/dreamhack-2023-0000-00-00" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">DreamHack Valencia 2023</a>

                                The meshes created include a cylinder, a cone, and a plane, which are placed in a scene with applied transformations and rotations.

                                <p>This project was my Bachelor's final thesis: a visual therapy tool designed to treat amblyopia and strabismus using virtual reality. 
                                I served as the sole programmer and was responsible for implementing all core functionalities, including the menu interface, VR integration, 
                                a JSON-based save system, and an adaptive difficulty mechanism. 
                                The project was showcased at the Match in Games event organized by UDIT, where it earned second place in the Professional Jury's Award.
